Discrete Optimisation
===============

Discrete optimisation is a very large topic, that includes in particular
ways to formulate and solve combinatorial search and enumeration problem, which
are ubiquitous in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Operational
Research, Machine Learning, and more.

If you've ever wondered how to program a Sudoku solver for instance,
and how complex it would be, this course will tell you exactly how to
do it.

In this course, we begin with linear programming, which is a starting
point for many discrete-based algorithms. We consider the contraints
of adding integer and binary constraints, which allows us to formulate
decision problems, in particular NP-complete problems.

We next consider specialized algorithms for which enumeration is fast
and efficient, such as transport and flow problems.

All along the course we provide numerous examples and tutorial sessions.

Code 1
------

Here you will find verbose, straightforward, numpy-based code for the
simplex.

Here is the basic code, [a Python Simplex solver](/files/simplexe.py),
with no claim with respect to efficiency. Here is a 
[Python Notebook](/files/Simplexe.ipynb), with worked out examples.

I recommend you try the Python Notebook version. Here is the
[online rendering](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/hugues-talbot.github.io/files/Simplexe.ipynb)
of this notebook. 



Thanks
------

Special thank to Dr. Maria Vakalopoulou and Pr. Fragkiskos Maillaros.



Sudoku solver
-----------

Here is a nice [Sudoku solver](/files/Sudoku_ilp.ipynb) written in Python. It requires
[cvxopt](http://cvxopt.org/install/index.html).



Peg Solitaire project
-------------------

A interesting project is to implement a peg-solitaire solver.

Here are a couple of articles on how this might be done [Article 1](/files/Peg_Solitaire_1.pdf) ; [Article 2](/files/Peg_Solitaire_2.pdf).


Signal, image processing project 
--------------------

A second project (choose only one) is to use transport problems (max-flow problems) to solve signal and image processing
problems.

Here are two useful articles [Interactive graph cuts](/files/interactive_graphcuts.pdf) and [energies minimizable by graph cuts](/files/what_energies_graphcuts.pdf) to get started. Here is a book chapter which is better illustrated [Graph cuts in vision](/files/GC_vision_th_applications.pdf).


Challenges 
---------

Students can elect to participate to a relevant Kaggle challenge. I recommend this new
[particle tracking](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification)
challenge. The top prize is 12,000\$ !

Other relevant challenges will be posted here.
